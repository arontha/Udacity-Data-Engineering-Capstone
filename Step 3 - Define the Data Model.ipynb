The fact table contains all of the most important fields which will be used to compare the data. The different dimension tables are not based on the source data but rather dividies the data into tables that will be of interest to the analysts using the schema.  \n",

    "A note on the data - the i94 dataset provides origin only as a country and destination only as a state. Therefore the city can only be matched with the temperature and airports (all found in the geography data). The demographic information on population is only available for US cities, and the destination is only available at the state level. Therefore, the population information will be transformed to the state level, which loses some granularity in the data but will be in a more useful format for the analysts who will only be viewing it at the state level. Since the temperature data is available worldwide, it will remain at the city level as an analyst may be interested in the temperature for either the destination state or the country of origin."
